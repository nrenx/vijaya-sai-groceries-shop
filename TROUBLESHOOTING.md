# Troubleshooting Guide for Supabase Integration

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Error: `private` modifier cannot be used in plain objects

**Error Message:**
```
Error: Failed to scan for dependencies from entries:
  Expected "}" but found "async"

  private async updateCustomerStats(
          ~~~~~
```

**Solution:**
In JavaScript/TypeScript, the `private` modifier can only be used in class declarations, not in plain objects. If you encounter this error in a service file, remove the `private` modifier from the method.

For example, change:
```typescript
export const someService = {
  /**
   * Some method description
   */
  private async someMethod() {
    // method implementation
  }
};
```

To:
```typescript
export const someService = {
  /**
   * Some method description
   */
  async someMethod() {
    // method implementation
  }
};
```

### 2. Supabase Connection Issues

If you're having trouble connecting to Supabase:

1. Check that your `.env` file contains the correct Supabase URL and anon key
2. Verify that the Supabase project is active
3. Check browser console for specific error messages

### 3. Database Schema Issues

If you encounter database-related errors:

1. Verify that you've run the `schema.sql` script in your Supabase project
2. Check that table names and column names match between your code and the database
3. Ensure that foreign key relationships are properly set up

### 4. Authentication Issues

If authentication is not working:

1. Verify that you've created a user in the Supabase Authentication dashboard
2. Check that the user has the correct permissions
3. Ensure that Row Level Security (RLS) policies are properly configured

### 5. Real-time Subscription Issues

If real-time updates are not working:

1. Verify that the subscription is properly set up in your code
2. Check that the channel name is unique
3. Ensure that the table name is correct in the subscription
